        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">By India Today Web Desk: Every individual wants to 
          receive the best of education to achieve his or her dreams. However, the more the
           institution is good, the higher the fees they charge. Students usually leave their
            education incomplete and do blue collar jobs to meet their basic ends. Moreover, 
            these students collect money to complete their masters later in career. Apart 
            from those who can afford expensive higher education, some handful of students gets scholarships.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In the age of internet and MOOCs,
           do we really need to spend huge amount on getting degrees? One can
            equally quench his third for knowledge by joining online classes.
             Online classes are not only cheap but also conveniently arranged for
              those who are working. What else a student would want if he gets free
               classes that too online. There are websites that provide free online
                courses or have resourceful material for students. These websites
                 are bejeweled with informative podcasts, videos and notes, they 
                 also take time-to-time assessment tests. Indeed, there should be
                  free flow of knowledge and it is beneficial for the students and 
                  teachers both.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">It's a myth to say that online education will
           go in vain, as the job market is more based on our skills, rather than our 
           degrees. What you know matters more than from where you have learnt. Nowadays,
            agencies hire students on the basis of their knowledge and ability to solve
             problems, keeping aside their grades or degrees.
